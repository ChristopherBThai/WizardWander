# WizardWander
A rogue-like game created for my high school project. Most of the artwork was created by my friend, while I did the coding.

[You can watch a gameplay here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnWPe5SS14Q&feature=youtu.be)


## How to Play
### Objective
The objective of this game is to get as far as you can. Each floor has a boss you must defeat to proceed to the next floor. As you progress up the floors, the difficulty will increase.

There are several types of enemies and bosses so be careful! They all have A\* pathfinding algorithms to get around the room and chase you!

All rooms and maps are randomly generated. You can check the top left corner of the screen to see the map! It's random every time and gets larger every floor!

There are a handful of items you can obtain through bosses and chests. Some improve your overall stats while others gives you new weapons and abilities!


### Controls
You can move with WASD controls and shoot with the arrow keys. Your spells can be used with the space key.


## About
This project was created in Eclipse in Java. All coding was done by Christopher Thai.
